## About

Monsieur Rezan is a french teacher and education content creator from Indonesia. For his professional branding, I was asked to build a landing website with three main technical features in mind:
1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
2. Mobile Responsiveness
3. Site Analytics
4. A form with automated e-mail confirmation

I also took the liberty of creating a headless CMS. See ![https://github.com/Veivel/monsieurrezan-backend](https://github.com/Veivel/monsieurrezan-backend).
