## About

Monsieur Rezan is a french teacher and education content creator from Indonesia. For his personal branding, I was asked to build a professional landing website with three main technical features in mind:
1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
2. Mobile Responsiveness
3. Site Analytics
4. A form with automated e-mail confirmation

I also took the liberty of creating a headless CMS. See (https://github.com/Veivel/monsieurrezan-backend)[https://github.com/Veivel/monsieurrezan-backend].

## Development Process & Tech

This is my first project using TypeScript, and first time utilizing Tailwind properly. It's also the first (hopefully of many!) freelance project I've taken for a client. To start, I had two separate discussions with the client: one as a high-level overview, to understand his motivation and what he really wants out of this; the second to narrow down the details of each page and component. 

After looking at a few reference sites, I started by shaping the flexboxes of the different sections (outline).

## What's next?
1. integrate with cms
2. look at other options for email
